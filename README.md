# CSS TRICKS

## AIM

## Estimated Time
- Nan
### TRICKK #1
- An hidden `text`
- A hidden `div` with a text that will be displayed when `hovered`
- It is done by playing with its `opacity` and adding a `background-color` somehow `transparent`
- check the [scss](_hidden.scss) and [html](hiddendisplay.html) for further understanding

### TRICKK #2
- A circular `progress-bar` 
- you need to know a little `Javascript`, `css` `conic gradient`, how piecharts work
- The `inner circle` sits ontop of the outer circle, then the `outer circle`'s background will change when we convert the percentage given to an angle that is then used for the [Conic-Gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients_conic.asp)

### TRICKK #3
- A `flip-card`
- When the card is `hovered` it flips between its faces
